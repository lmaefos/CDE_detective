        "raw_response": "To analyze whether each entry corresponds to the HEAL Core Common Data Elements (CDE) list, we will look at the descriptions of each entry from the `opioid_risk_tool` module and assess them against typical categories of risk factors, substance use histories, and other psychological conditions that may be included in a CDE list related to opioids.\n\nHere are the entries categorized based on the families of information typically found in CDE lists related to substance use and psychological factors:\n\n1. **Alcohol Family History**: Entry 1 matches as family history of substance abuse is usually included in risk assessments for opioid prescriptions and addiction potential.\n2. **Illegal Drugs Family History**: Entry 2 also matches as this is another field relevant to assessing opioid risk.\n3. **Rx Drugs Family History**: Entry 3 matches; family history involving prescription drugs is crucial for understanding potential addiction propensity.\n4. **Alcohol Personal History**: Entry 4 matches; personal history of substance abuse (in this case, alcohol) is a significant component of risk assessments.\n5. **Illegal Drugs Personal History**: Entry 5 matches; personal history of illegal drug use is commonly included in assessments.\n6. **Rx Drugs Personal History**: Entry 6 matches; knowledge of a person\u2019s prescription drug use history is vital for assessing risk.\n7. **Age Between 16-45 Years**: Entry 7 matches as age is a demographic risk factor frequently assessed in addiction studies.\n8. **History of Preadolescent Sexual Abuse**: Entry 8 matches; history of trauma (such as sexual abuse) may increase the risk of substance abuse and is often included in assessments.\n9. **Attention Deficit Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Bipolar, Schizophrenia**: Entry 9 matches; psychological disorders are relevant factors in risk assessments.\n10. **Illegal Drugs Personal History (Psychological Disease)**: Entry 10 matches conditionally; while this connects drugs to psychological conditions, personal history of substance abuse remains a relevant risk factor.\n11. **Depression**: Entry 11 matches; depression is a significant psychological factor linked to opioid risk.\n\n### Summary\nAll the entries (1 through 11) appear to correspond well with the types of data included in the HEAL Core Common Data Elements (CDE) list, as they cover various aspects of family history, personal history, demographic risk factors, and psychological conditions which are relevant for assessing opioid prescribing risk and addiction potential."
