Since I don't have access to external files or databases, I can guide you on how to perform this analysis.\n\nHere's a general approach you can follow:\n\n1. **Load the JSON Files**: Use a programming language like Python to load the JSON files into dictionaries.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Information**: Identify the module name and variable names from the first JSON file. Extract the HEAL CDE variables from the second JSON file.\n\n3. **Match Variables**: For each variable in the module, check against the HEAL CDE variables:\n   - Use exact string matching for \"HEAL CDE Match\".\n   - For \"Potential HEAL CDE Match\", look for similar themes or context (this may involve some string similarity checks or keyword matching).\n   - If there is no correspondence, classify it as \"No Match\".\n\n4. **Construct Output JSON**: For each variable, create a JSON structure as specified.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample Python code snippet to illustrate this process:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Load JSON data\nwith open('module_variables.json') as f:\n    module_data = json.load(f)\n\nwith open('heal_cde_variables.json') as f:\n    heal_cde_data = json.load(f)\n\n# Prepare output structure\noutput = {\n    \"module_name\": \"tobacco_alcohol_prescription_medication_substance\",\n    \"entries\": []\n}\n\n# Function to determine match type\ndef determine_match(variable_name, heal_cde_list):\n    if variable_name in heal_cde_list:\n        return \"HEAL CDE Match\"\n    elif any(keyword in variable_name for keyword in heal_cde_list):  # Example of partial match logic\n        return \"Potential HEAL CDE Match\"\n    else:\n        return \"No Match\"\n\n# Extract HEAL CDE variable names\nheal_cde_names = {cde['variable_name']: cde['heal_cde_name'] for cde in heal_cde_data}\n\n# Analyze each variable in the module\nfor variable in module_data['variables']:\n    variable_name = variable['name']\n    match_type = determine_match(variable_name, heal_cde_names.keys())\n    \n    if match_type == \"HEAL CDE Match\":\n        heal_cde_name = heal_cde_names[variable_name]\n        variable_cde_name = variable_name\n    elif match_type == \"Potential HEAL CDE Match\":\n        # Find a close match (this is an example; you might want to be more sophisticated)\n        heal_cde_name = \"Potential Match Found\"  # Placeholder\n        variable_cde_name = variable_name\n    else:\n        heal_cde_name = None\n        variable_cde_name = None\n    \n    output[\"entries\"].append({\n        \"name\": variable_name,\n        \"standards_mapping_type\": match_type,\n        \"heal_cde_name\": heal_cde_name,\n        \"variable_cde_name\": variable_cde_name\n    })\n\n# Output the result\nprint(json.dumps(output, indent=2))\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- You would need to modify the logic in `determine_match` to suit your specific matching criteria.\n- The example uses simple string matching; more advanced techniques could involve natural language processing (NLP) for better semantic understanding.\n- Ensure to handle cases where variable names may contain special characters or formatting differences. \n\nOnce you have the actual data, you can run this code to generate the desired output."

The components of the name can be broken down as follows:\n- \"gad7\": Refers to the GAD-7 scale.\n- \"notstop\": Suggests a focus on persistent worry or anxiety.\n- \"wryscl\": Likely refers to worry scale or a similar construct.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Match Type\nBased on the breakdown:\n- **HEAL CDE Match**: If there is a direct match with a HEAL CDE variable related to GAD-7 or anxiety measurements.\n- **Potential HEAL CDE Match**: If it aligns with anxiety-related constructs but is not an exact match.\n- **No Match**: If it does not correspond to any HEAL CDE variable.\n\n### Step 4: Construct the JSON Output\nAssuming we have found a direct match in the HEAL CDE variables, the output would look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"module_name\": \"generalized_anxiety_disorder_7\",\n  \"entries\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"gad7notstopwryscl\",\n      \"standards_mapping_type\": \"HEAL CDE Match\",\n      \"heal_cde_name\": \"Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale\",\n      \"variable_cde_name\": \"GAD7_not_stop_worry_scale\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Note:\n- If there is no direct match but a partial match is identified, the `standards_mapping_type` would change to \"Potential HEAL CDE Match\" and the relevant HEAL CDE name and variable name would be adjusted accordingly.\n- If no matches are found, the `standards_mapping_type` would be \"No Match\" and the `heal_cde_name` and `variable_cde_name` fields would be left empty or marked as null.\n\nPlease replace the example HEAL CDE name and variable name with the actual values from the HEAL CDE JSON file after performing the necessary comparisons."
