The entries consist of various factors related to substance abuse, personal history, and socio-demographic factors that may influence opioid risk, such as family history of substance abuse.\n\n### Analysis of Entries\n\n1. **Entry 1: Alcohol Family History**\n   - **CDE Alignment**: This type of data is often relevant in understanding substance abuse risk. However, there is no direct reference in the CDE list provided for specific entries regarding "family history of alcohol use."\n  \n2. **Entry 2: Illegal Drugs Family History**\n   - **CDE Alignment**: Similar to Entry 1, this is also relevant for substance abuse risk, but specific CDEs related to "family history" of illegal drug use are not found in the provided CDE list.\n\n3. **Entry 3: Prescription Drugs Family History**\n   - **CDE Alignment**: While data about family history regarding prescription drugs might correlate indirectly to opioid risk, there’s no specific CDE matching this exact criterion.\n\n4. **Entry 4: Alcohol Personal History**\n   - **CDE Alignment**: Personal history of substance abuse is significant, but, again, there’s no direct corresponding CDE for this specific entry.\n\n5. **Entry 5: Illegal Drugs Personal History**\n   - **CDE Alignment**: Same as Entry 4, relevance to opioid risk is documented through personal history but no matching CDE exists.\n\n6. **Entry 6: Prescription Drugs Personal History**\n   - **CDE Alignment**: Personal history regarding prescription drugs plays a role in assessing risk; however, the CDE list does not clearly reflect this data point.\n\n7. **Entry 7: Age Between 16-45 Years**\n   - **CDE Alignment**: Age as a demographic factor is well-represented in the CDE list, making this entry relevant to the analysis.\n\n8. **Entry 8: History of Preadolescent Sexual Abuse**\n   - **CDE Alignment**: This information could have implications for behavioral health and substance abuse but it does not appear explicitly in the CDE.\n\n9. **Entry 9: Psychological Disease**\n   - **CDE Alignment**: Diagnoses like ADD, OCD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia can influence substance use. Nevertheless, no explicit matches in the CDE list are found for these specific conditions.\n\n10. **Entry 10: Illegal Drugs Personal History**\n    - **CDE Alignment**: Similar to earlier personal history entries, pertinent but lacking clear representation in the CDE list.\n\n11. **Entry 11: Depression**\n    - **CDE Alignment**: Depression is a recognized factor in substance use disorders; the CDE references it but does not indicate a specific mapping from opioid risk tools.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- Many entries for the \'opioid_risk_tool\' module correspond to risk factors associated with substance abuse and relapse potential; however, their lack of direct, specific mappings within the provided HEAL Core CDE list indicates that while they are conceptually relevant, they may not be explicitly outlined as HEAL CDEs.\n- Entries related to personal and family histories (for alcohol, illegal drugs, and prescription drugs) are pivotal in understanding the composite risk profile but aren\'t directly stipulated as CDEs.\n- Age, personal abuse histories, and psychological conditions are relevant but would need to be linked to more generic CDEs that cover demographic factors, psychosocial elements, or common mental health disorders.\n\nIn conclusion, while many of the \'opioid_risk_tool\' entries reflect important factors affecting opioid risk, there are few explicit matches within the HEAL Core CDE list, indicating a potential gap that could be addressed to enhance data richness in understanding opioid use risk.'}, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop'}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 80491, 'completion_tokens': 797, 'total_tokens': 81288}, 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ba606877f9'}

There seems to be a solid match for demographic data (birth date, age, gender, ethnicity), socio-economic data (income, employment, education), and health-related assessments (PHQ-8 questions and pain ratings). \n\nHowever, it would be beneficial to also double-check the specific permissible values and definitions from the HEAL CDEs to ensure precise alignment but overall, there is a strong alignment in terms of purpose and content.'}, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop'}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 87338, 'completion_tokens': 975, 'total_tokens': 88313}, 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ba606877f9'}
