This aligns well with the overarching aim of the HEAL CDE, which is to systematically measure and understand pain-related outcomes and influencing factors like substance use.\n\n2. **Data Types**: All entries utilize a boolean format along with integer encodings (0 and 1), and while the HEAL CDEs utilize a variety of data types, the boolean type may correspond indirectly to categorical measures found in the CDE list.\n\n3. **Psychological & Substance Use Factors**: Some entries (such as those focusing on personal and family history of substance abuse) correspond to psychological measures found in the HEAL CDE list. For example:\n   - The **depression** entry clearly aligns with CDEs related to mental health assessment.\n   - Entries regarding substance use may relate to CDEs that assess risk factors associated with substance use or misuse.\n\n4. **Age and Psychological Factors**: The entry regarding age could have relevance in demographic categories or stratification within CDEs that monitor different age effects on pain and treatment outcomes.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe entries from the 'opioid_risk_tool' module broadly align with the themes and objectives of the HEAL Core Common Data Elements list. They monitor various risk factors related to substance use and mental health, which are crucial in understanding and evaluating treatment outcomes in pain management. However, direct mapping to specific CDEs may require cross-referencing and further detailing based on the exact definitions and classifications in the HEAL CDE list.\n\nFor specific CDE mapping and assessments, further clarification on each entry's alignment with established CDE outputs would be beneficial."}, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop'}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 80491, 'completion_tokens': 904, 'total_tokens': 81395}, 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ba606877f9'}

A few entries related to ethnicity details aren\'t distinctly categorized within the CDE list, particularly where it provides options like "Don’t Know" or "Refuse to Answer." However, many entries like date of birth, age, gender, and various psychological screening scores align effectively with established CDEs. \n\nOverall, the entries demonstrate a strong alignment with the CDE framework, particularly in the areas aimed at capturing demographic and health-related data. Further refinement could improve alignment, specifically on optional responses in ethnicity and other subjective categories.'}, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop'}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 87338, 'completion_tokens': 1263, 'total_tokens': 88601}, 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_611b667b19'}
