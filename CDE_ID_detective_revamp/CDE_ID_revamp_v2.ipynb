      "- Rationale: The entry name \"promis_pediatric_anxiety_8a\" directly suggests that the questionnaire is part of the PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) specifically designed to assess anxiety in pediatric populations. The descriptions provided focus on feelings of nervousness, fear, and worry, which align with the typical content of an anxiety assessment. The \"8a\" likely refers to the version or form number of this specific PROMIS measure. \n",
