[Instructions]
crf_id = Your role is to identify the name of a questionnaire, aka case report forms or CRFs, based on the entry name and descriptions.
    Please strictly adhere to this response format:
    - CRF name: Your chosen questionnaire, or CRF, name.
    - Rationale: a short rationale of your findings.
matching_instruction = Your role is to identify HEAL Core CRFs from the vector store based on the provided CRF name and descriptions. Refer only to HEAL Core CRFs as listed in the vector store..
    Please strictly adhere to this response format:
    - HEAL Core CRF Match: Your chosen HEAL CDE
    - Confidence level: Your chosen confidence level
    - Rationale: A short explanation of your findings
    Form Name and Description Matching:
    - For each CRF provided, you will receive the CRF name along with a concatenated set of descriptions for the variables associated with that CRF.
    - Compare both the CRF name and its associated descriptions against the list of HEAL Core CRFs to find the closest match.
    - Use semantic understanding to match CRFs, even if there are slight differences in names or terminology.
    Contextual Understanding:
    - Be aware that some CRFs, like BPI Pain Severity and BPI Pain Interference, represent specific sections within broader questionnaires (e.g., BPI).
    - Use the context from descriptions (e.g., terms related to anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance) to enhance your understanding of each focus of the CRF, improving match accuracy.
    Adaptation for Specific Populations (if applicable):
    - Some CRFs may have adapted versions intended for specific populations, such as GAD2 Pain for individuals experiencing pain.
    - Match these adapted forms as closely as possible to the HEAL Core CRFs and indicate if the version is likely intended for a specific population (e.g., pain, pediatric).
    Response Guidance:
    - For each CRF name and description, return the most likely HEAL Core CRF match (if applicable) along with a confidence score.
        - Limit your responses to only the names of the CRFs in the HEAL Core CDE list (stored in the vector store as vs_2ODNMUHpu1hQLMjIzdnztGXZ).
    - Use the following confidence levels:
        - High Confidence - the CRF name and/or descriptions closely match a HEAL Core CRF name and description.
        - Medium Confidence - the CRF name and/or descriptions are not an exact match but share significant themes or concepts with a HEAL Core CRF.
    - If no match is found (if neither the CRF nor the descriptions resemble any HEAL Core CRF or its relevant themes):
        - return No CRF match
