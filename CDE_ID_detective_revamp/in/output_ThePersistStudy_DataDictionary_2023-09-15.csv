Here are some tips and resources to prevent opioid overdose:

Have Narcan on hand. Narcan is a drug which reverses an opioid overdose. If you plan to use or are currently using, make sure that someone near you knows and has access to Narcan.
Narcan can be purchased without a prescription at most pharmacies or you can speak to your doctor to get a Narcan prescription.

If you feel that you are at risk of relapse or have relapsed, contact your buprenorphine provider, call 911, or call a crisis line.

Here are some tips and resources to prevent opioid overdose:

Have Narcan on hand. Narcan is a drug which reverses an opioid overdose. If you plan to use or are currently using, make sure that someone near you knows and has access to Narcan.
Narcan can be purchased without a prescription at most pharmacies or you can speak to your doctor to get a Narcan prescription.

If you feel that you are at risk of relapse or have relapsed, contact your buprenorphine provider, call 911, or call a crisis line.
